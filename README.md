# rabbitmq-service-sinatra-sample

This is a very simple Sinatra application demonstrating the use of the
RabbitMQ service on Cloud Foundry, or the RabbitMQ add-on on heroku.

To try out the sample for yourself, clone the repository and, in its base directory, run the following:

    $ heroku create
    Creating hollow-mountain-815... done, stack is bamboo-mri-1.9.2
    http://hollow-mountain-815.heroku.com/ |
    git@heroku.com:hollow-mountain-815.git
    Git remote heroku added
    $ git push heroku master
    Counting objects: 64, done.
    Delta compression using up to 2 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (49/49), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (64/64), 86.59 KiB, done.
    Total 64 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)

Your own application will get a name different from `hollow-mountain-815`. You can change this name in your [Heroku web console](https://api.heroku.com/myapps) if you'd like.

Then provision a RabbitMQ Bigwig instance:

    $ heroku addons:add rabbitmq-bigwig

And visit your sample application!
